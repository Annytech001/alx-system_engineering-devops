Web stack debugging is the process of finding and fixing problems in a web application. A web application usually has different parts:

Frontend (Client-Side): What you see and interact with on a website (e.g., buttons, text).
Backend (Server-Side): The behind-the-scenes part that handles data and logic.
Database: Where all the data is stored.
Server/Hosting: Where the website lives online.
APIs: The connections between the different parts of the app.
When you debug, you look for issues in these areas and fix them to make sure the whole app works smoothly.
